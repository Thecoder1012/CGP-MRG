# **Cutting Costs, Not Corners: Multi-Modal Medical Report Generation for Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease with Fine-Tuned Large Language Models**
---

**CGP-MRG** (Cognition-Guided Prompting for Medical Report Generation) is a cutting-edge approach designed to generate accurate, cost-effective, and efficient medical reports for Alzheimer's Disease. Leveraging fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs), this project aims to deliver high-quality outputs while maintaining cost efficiency.

## üöÄ **Installation**
To set up the environment, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cgp-mrg.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd cgp-mrg

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üìñ **Usage**

### Run Inference on the ADMR-Test Dataset:
```bash
python3 ./LLM-Codes/infer.py
```

### Use Direct Probabilities from Classification Models:
```bash
python3 ./LLM-Codes/baseline_comp_sample.py
```

### Fine-Tune LLM Models:
To fine-tune the models in our setting, use the following command:
```bash
python3 ./LLM-Codes/llama3.py
```
> **Note:** This script is configured for **LLaMA 3**. You can explore other models like **Unsloth** from _Hugging Face_ for LoRA fine-tuning.

## üìä **Models and Data**
