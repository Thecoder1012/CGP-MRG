![CGP-MRG_v2-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28d2dc61-9f92-42ab-a9f9-5cc42c0e7f81)

CGP-MRG (Cognition-Guided Prompting for Medical Report Generation) is an innovative approach to generating medical reports for Alzheimer's Disease using fine-tuned Large Language Models. This project aims to provide accurate, cost-effective, and efficient medical report generation while maintaining high-quality outputs.

### Installation
````
clone the git

pip install -r requirements.txt
````
### Usage

To run the code on the ADMR-Test dataset:
```
python3 ./LLM-Codes/infer.py
````

To use direct probabilities from classification models:
````
python3 ./LLM-Codes/baseline_comp_sample.py
````
